          <div class="text2">An atom is the smallest unit of matter, made up of three main particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons form the nucleus at the center, while electrons orbit around it. Protons are positively charged, neutrons have no charge, and electrons are negatively charged. The way electrons are arranged determines how atoms bond with each other to form molecules.

            The atomic theory, developed by scientists like John Dalton and Niels Bohr, is fundamental to understanding chemistry, physics, and technology. Atoms are the building blocks of everything in the universe.
